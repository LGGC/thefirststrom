  GER_wilhelm_iii_DESC:0 "The eldest Grandchild of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert- more commonly referred to by his Regnal Name, Wilhelm II- is the Third Kaiser of the Deutsches Kaiserreich. Having come into his position at a time when most would agree he was far from being in a position to fulfill his duties, Wilhelm II has, to the surprise of many, grown into quite a competent ruler. However, his competence is meaningless when paired with his relatively unimpressive stature, voice and frame, all compounded by a withered arm. A deep mistrust of Britain- including his own relatives in the British Royal Family-, an unflinching hatred for the French Republic, and a desire to ensure Germany’s position on the World Stage is unquestioned from his reign onward are all converging to make Wilhelm II one of the most consequential monarchs in history."
